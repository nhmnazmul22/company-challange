| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`       | Start Next.js in **development** mode with Turbopack.              |
| `npm run build`     | Create an optimized **production build** using Turbopack.          |
| `npm run start`     | Run the production server (after `build`).                         |
| `npm run lint`      | Lint the codebase with **ESLint**.                                 |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check the codebase with **TypeScript** (no files emitted).    |
